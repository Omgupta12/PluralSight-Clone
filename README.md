# PluralSight-clone

In this project, we have used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our project is to clone the PluralSight website, an American privately held online education company that offers a variety of video training courses for software developers, IT administrators, and creative professionals through its website.

The Project was so challenging because we have to complete it within 6 days. But because of hard work and excellent teamwork, the work was completed in 5 days. We tried our level best to make our work similar to the original website. This project helps to make my concepts clear and to get a better understanding of group work.
